Minimalist tech-art, a single, elegant circular control knob made of brushed dark metal sits on a clean, reflective surface.
An intricate audio waveform, visualized as a vibrant blue and magenta glowing hologram, emerges and swirls gracefully above the knob.
The background is a dark, minimalist void, emphasizing the glowing waveform.
Studio lighting, sharp focus, high detail, FUI design, data visualization aesthetic.

prompt:

```
Digital art, glowing streams of light shaped like audio sound waves flow in parallel from left to right.
The streams pass through a series of minimalist, semi-transparent glass cubes that act as nodes.
After passing through the nodes, the multiple streams elegantly merge into a single, thicker, brighter data stream.
The background is a deep, dark blue void with a subtle grid pattern. Vibrant neon cyan and electric purple colors.
Clean, abstract, high-tech.
