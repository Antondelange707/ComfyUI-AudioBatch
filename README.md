# ComfyUI Audio Batch & Utility Nodes &#x0001F3A7;&#x0001F39B;&#xFE0F;

This repository provides a set of custom nodes for ComfyUI focused on audio batching and common audio processing tasks like
channel conversion and resampling. These nodes are designed to help manage and prepare audio data within your ComfyUI
workflows, especially when dealing with multiple audio inputs or outputs.


## &#x2699;&#xFE0F; Main features

&#x2705; No extra dependencies, we use the same modules as ComfyUI

&#x2705; All operations accepts batches (multiple audio in the same noodle)

&#x2705; Batch: create and separate

&#x2705; Conversion: channels and sample rate

&#x2705; Manipulation: cut, concatenate, blend, join/split stereo, de/normalization

&#x2705; QoL: audio information, download audio, musical note to freq, signal generator

## &#x2728; Nodes

### 1. Batch Audios
   - **Display Name:** `Batch Audios`
   - **Internal Name:** `SET_AudioBatch`
   - **Category:** `audio/batch`
   - **Description:** Takes two audio inputs (which can themselves be batches) and combines them into a single, larger audio batch. The node handles differences in sample rate, channel count, and length between the two inputs to produce a unified batch.
   - **Inputs:**
     - `audio1` (AUDIO): The first audio input. Can be a single audio item or a batch.
     - `audio2` (AUDIO): The second audio input. Can be a single audio item or a batch.
   - **Output:**
     - `audio_batch` (AUDIO): A single audio object where the waveforms from `audio1` and `audio2` are concatenated along the batch dimension.
   - **Behavior Details:**
     - **Sample Rate:** All audio in the output batch will be resampled to match the sample rate of `audio1`.
     - **Channels:**
       - If both inputs are mono, the output batch will be mono.
       - If one input is mono and the other is stereo, the mono input will be converted to "fake stereo" (by duplicating its channel), and the output batch will be stereo.
       - If both inputs are stereo, the output batch will be stereo.
       - For more complex multi-channel inputs, it defaults to the maximum channel count of the two inputs with a warning, as advanced downmixing is not performed.
     - **Length (Samples):** All audio clips in the output batch will be padded with silence at the end to match the length of the longest clip (after any resampling).
     - **Input Batch Handling:** If `audio1` has B1 items and `audio2` has B2 items, the output `audio_batch` will contain B1 + B2 items.

### 2. Select Audio from Batch

   - **Internal Name:** `SET_SelectAudioFromBatch`
   - **Category:** `audio/batch`

     - `index` (INT): The 0-based index of the audio stream to select from the batch.
     - `behavior_out_of_range` (COMBO): What to do if the `index` is out of range:
       - `silence_original_length` (default): Output silent audio with the same channel count and duration as items in the original batch.
       - `silence_fixed_length`: Output silent audio with a duration specified by `silence_duration_seconds`.
       - `error`: Raise an error (which will halt the workflow and display an error in ComfyUI).
     - `silence_duration_seconds` (FLOAT): The duration of the silent audio if `behavior_out_of_range` is set to `silence_fixed_length`.
   - **Output:**
     - `selected_audio` (AUDIO): The selected audio stream (as a batch of 1) or silent audio if the index was out of range (and behavior was not "error").

   - **Inputs:**
     - `audio_bypass` (AUDIO, Optional): If an audio is provided here it will be used for the output. You can connect a `Load Audio` node here, if the connected node is muted (bypassed) we download the file, otherwise we use the audio from the `Load Audio` node.
     - `base_url` (STRING): The URL of the directory containing the audio file.
     - `filename` (STRING): The name of the file to download and load (e.g., `music.mp3`).

     - `audio` (AUDIO): The loaded audio signal.
   - **Behavior Details:**
     - **Caching:** The node checks the `ComfyUI/input/` folder first. If the file with the specified `filename` already exists, the download is skipped.
     - **Resampling:** `torchaudio` is used to load the audio, and it will resample to `target_sample_rate` during loading if a non-zero value is provided.
     - **Player**: This node uses an `AUDIO_UI` widget to allow playing the downloaded song.


## &#x0001F680; Installation

You can install the nodes from the ComfyUI nodes manager, the name is *Audio Batch*, or just do it manually:

1.  Clone this repository into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
    git clone https://github.com/set-soft/ComfyUI-AudioBatch ComfyUI-AudioBatch
    ```
2.  Restart ComfyUI.

The nodes should then appear under the "audio/batch", "audio/conversion","audio/manipulation", "audio/generation" and "audio/io" categories in the "Add Node" menu.


## &#x0001F4E6; Dependencies

- PyTorch
- Torchaudio (for resampling and potentially other audio operations)
- NumPy (often used with audio data)
- Requests (optional): Usually an indirect ComfyUI dependency. If installed it will be used for downloads, it should be more robust than then built-in `urllib`, used as fallback.
- Colorama (optional): Might help to get colored log messages on some terminals. We use ANSI escape sequences when it isn't installed.

These are typically already present in a standard ComfyUI environment.

## &#x0001F5BC;&#xFE0F; Examples

Once installed the examples are available in the ComfyUI workflow templates, in the *Audio Batch* section (or ComfyUI-AudioBatch).

- [audio_batch_select_example.json](example_workflows/audio_batch_select_example.json): Shows how to create a batch and
  how to extract a single element from the batch.
- [audio_batch_select_example_extra.json](example_workflows/audio_batch_select_example_extra.json): This is like
  **audio_batch_select_example.json**, but shows how to use `Audio Download and Load`, so you have three aeasy to use
  audio files that are automatically downloaded.
- [resample_force_stereo.json](example_workflows/resample_force_stereo.json): Shows how to change the number of channels
  and the sample rate.
- [resample_force_stereo_extra.json](example_workflows/resample_force_stereo_extra.json): This is like
  **resample_force_stereo.json** but with more information (needs Easy-Use nodes) and shows how to use `Audio Download and Load`
- [generate_and_blend.json](example_workflows/generate_and_blend.json): Shows how to generate four musical notes and blend
  them together to create a chord.
- [cut_and_concat.json](example_workflows/cut_and_concat.json): Shows how to cut and concatenate audio.
- [normalize_and_undo.json](example_workflows/normalize_and_undo.json): Shows how to normalize audio level and then revert it.

## &#x0001F4DD; Usage Notes

- **AUDIO Type:** These nodes work with ComfyUI's standard "AUDIO" data type, which is a Python dictionary containing:
  - `'waveform'`: A `torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_channels, num_samples)`.
  - `'sample_rate'`: An `int` representing the sample rate in Hz.
- **Logging:** &#x0001F50A; The nodes use Python's `logging` module. Debug messages can be helpful for understanding the transformations being applied.
  You can control log verbosity through ComfyUI's startup arguments (e.g., `--preview-method auto --verbose DEBUG` for more detailed ComfyUI logs
  which might also affect custom node loggers if they are configured to inherit levels). The logger name used is "AudioBatch".
  You can force debugging level for these nodes defining the `AUDIOBATCH_NODES_DEBUG` environment variable to `1`.

## &#x0001F6E0;&#xFE0F; Future Improvements / TODO

- Add more sophisticated downmixing options for multi-channel audio (e.g., 5.1 to stereo).
- Allow user to choose padding value (e.g., silence, edge, reflect) for length matching in "Batch Audios".
- Option in "Batch Audios" to truncate to shortest instead of padding to longest.
- More options for stereo-to-mono conversion (e.g., take left channel, take right channel).
- If you are interested on them, please open an issue.
